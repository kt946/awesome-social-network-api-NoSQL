## Description

For this project, I built an API for a social network application using my knowledge of NoSQL, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, and Mongosse ODM. This back-end application uses a NoSQL database that allows developers to view, create, update, and delete users and thoughts. Developers are also able to add and remove friends to a user's friend list as well as create and remove reactions to thoughts. This challenge expanded my knowledge on NoSQL databases and how full-stack applications can benefit from the flexibility of unstructured data.
